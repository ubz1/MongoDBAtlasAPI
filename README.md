# Repo with examples for calling the MongoDB Atlas API (https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/api/) from Bash scripts

## These scripts require the standard tools:
## - jq to parse JSON (https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/)
## - curl to make the API calls

## ATLASAPIKEY='OrgPublicKey:OrgPrivateKey' needs to be filled in with Organization Owner access key.

## Scripts are provided as an example and not for production use. Use at your own risk.
